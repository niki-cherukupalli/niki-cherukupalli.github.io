    <p>
      I am currently a rising sophomore at Rutgers University majoring in Computer Science,
      <br>developing my skills through formal Java and C coursework and self-study in Go and SQL.
      <br>I am actively mastering algorithms, data structures, and excited to apply my knowledge to real-world initiatives in cybersecurity,
      <br>software development, and AI. Open to opportunities to develop and test these skills!
